# impwellbeing

## Basics

This repo has been set up for impwellbeing to explore 
the feasibility of creating a survey based system that can 
be used to monitor the wellbeing of our employees.

The hope is that by reporting on this we can increase the 
conversation on employee wellbeing and make employers take 
more of an active role in looking after their employees.

## Running the application locally
